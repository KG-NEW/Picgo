## Introduction

Have you met with these troubles? when connecting a couple of sensor modules toMEGA control board, sometimes power output interfaces are not enough, so need to use the breadboard and the wiring is rather troublesome.
Now don't worry about that. You can use this keyestudio MEGA sensor shield.It is fully compatible with MEGA control board, so that you can easily stack theMEGA sensor shield onto the MEGA control board.
The shield comes with digital and analog interfaces in 3PIN (G V S), easy toconnect the 3PIN sensor modules. Besides, it comes with communication pins of 2.54mm pin pitch, such as serial and SPI communication.

It comes with a reset button and 2 signal indicators as well.
Note: for the 3PIN interface, the voltage of Analog pins (labeled V) is 5V; while thevoltage of Digital pins (labeled V) is VCC, that is, the voltage input via a blue terminal block, default by jumper connected, connecting the voltage to 5V on the shield.

## Features

- Can be plugged into the MEGA control boardComes with a Reset button
- Comes with a power led and a D13 indicator
- Extends the digital and analog interface of MEGA into 3PINComes with a serial communication interface
- Extends an ICSP interfaceExtends a SPI interface Extends a URF01 interface Extends an APC220 interface
- Able to supply the voltage to sensor modules via the terminal block (jumpercap off)
